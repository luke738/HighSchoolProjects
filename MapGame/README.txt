A rather unorganized attempt at creating an online version of a pen and paper (or iPad and stylus) game a friend came up with similar to Risk.
Mostly intended to be a more convient replacement of the original game, still lacking a lot of polish and content. And security for user accounts is very lacking (I warned anyone who helped test it to never put anything real it, not that it ever went online).
Data storage is pretty simple too, the goal was to get it finished before the current session at the time ended (didn't happen).
Uses Javascript and HTML5 Canvas for the front-end and PHP for the back-end.
