A numerical simulation of n-body newtonian gravity in 3d.
Can be used to simulate actual physical systems, and also to make some interesting-looking animations of a large number of bodies interacting.
Based off of some of the work from BallisticSim and OrbitalSim, uses 3rd order explicit Adams-Bashford method for numerical integration.
Much faster than the earlier simulators.
