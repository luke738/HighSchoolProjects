# HighSchoolProjects
A collection of mostly java projects I made during my last two years of highschool.
Majority of the projects are java, but there is some web development. Various stages of functionality, usability, and completion. Lots of physcis simulation type programs, but also a few simple calculators or games.
Most projects are currently undocumented, but that will change.
