A numerical simulation program to plot the flight path of a water-bottle rocket in 2 dimensions under the influence of gravity and drag and with an inital speed and acceleration determined by the size of the bottle, amount of water, and pressure of the bottle.
Uses a simple rectrangular numerical integration scheme to compute the velocity and position of each rocket.
Can simulate a large number of rockets at a single time.
Written as part of an AP Physics lab.
